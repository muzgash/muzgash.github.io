      <description>MARBLES is short for Marvelous Arduino &amp;amp; Raspberrypi Biorreactor Lightweight Electronic System. It is a remotely controlled electronic system that helps adjust the light intensity, turn on/off the CO2 injection and measure the density of algae in a small bioreactor. It can b controlled from your cellphone or any webbrowser and it plots all the measures and the intensity during the duration of the setup.
All the information on the lab notebook (including circuit designs) can be found in the blog of the project MARBLES</description>

The entire prohect is yet to be uploaded to github but meanwhile this is the list of docs and tools I used:</description>
